char_sense

A program for compiling statistics on the use of letters in the text.
To use it, place the .txt file in the input_text folder, then run the app.py file.
This program will then take the first file from that tab and give you statistics on the use of letters in that text document.

Also you can choose in which form you want to get the result, you can set it in the config.py file
